As a critical zone scientist, I develop conceptual and numerical hydrological models, incorporating multidisciplinary field data and remote sensing. I am currently a Research Associate within [Kamini Singha research group](https://people.mines.edu/ksingha/) at the Colorado School of Mines. Earlier in my career, I worked in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, addressing water security and environmental challenges by designing multidisciplinary frameworks.

My current research aims to develop passive and active electrical monitoring to quantify the influence of vegetation on water fluxes within the critical zone. I also create geophysical frameworks to monitor soil-tree hydrological and physiological response to climate change, e.g., drought and wildfire smoke. My research relies on instrumental developments for geophysical monitoring in both field and laboratory experiments to develop hydrogeophysical models.
